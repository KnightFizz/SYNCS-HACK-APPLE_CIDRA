## Project Description
**Name: Breakfast Brawls**
Inspiration
Our project draws inspiration from Nintendo's Pokémon Card Game and Ring Fit Adventure. We aim to blend fitness with competitive gameplay, using exercise to power players' abilities in a virtual card battle. This hybrid approach engages users physically while fostering social interaction and healthy competition.

Fitness Battle Game is an innovative multiplayer game that leverages webcam-based exercise tracking to reward players with in-game attributes. These attributes, represented as game icons, can be used in a turn-based battle system where players compete to defeat each other. The project aligns with the theme, "Software that brings people together," by encouraging collaboration and friendly competition through physical activity, blending fitness and entertainment in a fun, social experience.

### Technology Stack
- Python packages && repos:
  - https://github.com/tocoteron/joycon-python
  - https://github.com/google/mediapipe
- Flask
- Next.js
- Procreate

#### Models
The pose detection used in this project is based on Google's Mediapipe framework, which is a cross-platform machine learning library designed to identify multiple pose positions. Mediapipe provides robust tools for real-time pose tracking and recognition, enabling applications that rely on accurate body pose estimations to identify various body positions and movements.

### Functions:
- Players use their webcams to detect and track specific exercise postures, such as squats, curls, and lateral raises. Successfully performing each posture rewards the player with an icon that unlocks unique attack abilities. 
- The game requires at least two players, each joining from their own computer. 
- Players can engage in battles using the icons they’ve earned. These icons represent abilities or attacks that can be strategically deployed during the battle, much like in a Pokémon card competition. 
- Each player has a Hit Points (HP) bar displayed on-screen. The game concludes when a player’s HP is reduced to zero. 
- A helpful guide is displayed in the bottom-left corner of the screen, providing players with instructions and tips as they play.

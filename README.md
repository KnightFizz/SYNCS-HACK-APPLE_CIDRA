## Project Description
### Product Name

### Technology Stack
- Python packages && repos:
  - https://github.com/tocoteron/joycon-python
  - https://github.com/google/mediapipe
- Flask
- Next.js

#### Models
The pose detection used in this project is based on Google's Mediapipe framework, which is a cross-platform machine learning library designed to identify multiple pose positions. Mediapipe provides robust tools for real-time pose tracking and recognition, enabling applications that rely on accurate body pose estimations to identify various body positions and movements.


### Brief:

### Functions:
- Players use their webcam to detect and track their exercise postures(squat && curl currently). Each successful posture grants a player an icon with specific attributes that can be used in a battle.
- The game requires at least two players, each participating from their own computer.
- Players can compete against each other using the icons they have earned. The icons grant abilities or attacks during the battle, similar to a Pokémon card competition.
- A Hit Points（HP）bar is displayed for each player, and the game ends when one player's HP reaches zero.
- (Optional) Before entering the game, players can customize their avatar or character.

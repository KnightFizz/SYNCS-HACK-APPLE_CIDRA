The pose detection used in this project is based on Google's Mediapipe framework, which is a cross-platform machine learning library designed to identify multiple pose positions. Mediapipe provides robust tools for real-time pose tracking and recognition, enabling applications that rely on accurate body pose estimations to identify various body positions and movements.
